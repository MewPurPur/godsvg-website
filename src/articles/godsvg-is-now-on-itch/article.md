Hello everyone!

Along with the release of [GodSVG's fifth alpha](https://godsvg.com/article/1-0-alpha5), I have another announcement to make.

# GodSVG on Itch.io

I have recently published GodSVG on Itch.io, where you can download it or use it directly from the browser. Users are politely encouraged by Itch.io to purchase GodSVG for $10, but it is available for free. Itch.io will get the same version of GodSVG as all other platforms (alpha 5 currently) and there won't be any delays.

This means that you can now get GodSVG officially on three different places:
- **Github:** [Downloads](https://github.com/MewPurPur/GodSVG/releases)
- **godsvg.com:** [Downloads](https://godsvg.com/releases) and [Web editor](https://godsvg.com/editor)
- **Itch.io:** [Downloads & Web editor](https://mewpurpur.itch.io/godsvg)

While I’m unfamiliar with digital distribution platforms, I’ve always admired Itch.io, and I thoroughly researched it to make sure I did everything correctly, and that my project is appropriate for it. If you find any issues, please let me know.
